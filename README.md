dotfiles of @dideler
====================

I'd love to hear from you if any of my dotfiles came in handy.

The [installation](install) script will link all the dotfiles in this
repository to your $HOME. If you're using this repository and have any
dotfiles that you want to include, you'll have to manually move/copy them over
to the repo's directory and then run the script to link them.

My bash files are no longer being maintained,
I've switched to the [fish shell](http://www.fishshell.com).

Some terminal tools I like but aren't dotfiles:
