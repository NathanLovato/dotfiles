Dotfiles typically reside in $HOME.
Note that I've removed the beginning dot from the files & directories in this repo.

My bash files are no longer being maintained, I've switched to the fish shell.

syntax/ -> ~/.vim/syntax/
plugin/ -> ~/.vim/plugin/
functions/ -> ~/.config/fish/functions/

Some console stuff I really like but aren't neccesarily dotfiles:
